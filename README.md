GEDCOM 5.5 to GEDCOM X Converter
================================

This utility converts a [GEDCOM 5.5 file](http://www.gedcomx.org/GEDCOM-5.5.1.pdf) to a
[GEDCOM X file](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/file-format-specification.md).
The utility leverages the open-source [GEDCOM 5.5 parsing library](https://github.com/DallanQ/GEDCOM)
contributed by Dallan Quass and the open-source [GEDCOM X file format writer](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-fileformat-java)
contributed by FamilySearch.

## Usage

Someday, [we may get a GUI for this utility](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcom5-conversion/issues/1).
But for now, you're going to have to run it from the command line:

1. [Install the Java Runtime Environment](http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp).
2. [Download the latest version of the utility]() and save it on your filesystem (e.g. `/tmp/gedcom-converter.jar`).
3.
